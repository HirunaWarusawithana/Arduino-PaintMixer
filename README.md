Automated Paint Mixing Machine Using Arduino

Developed a fully automated paint mixing machine leveraging Arduino for precise control of paint quantities and mixing. The project involved programming an Arduino microcontroller to integrate various components, including motors and sensors, to ensure accurate and consistent paint mixtures. Key tasks included:

Designing and wiring the electronics for motor control and sensor feedback.
Writing efficient code to manage the mixing process and ensure real-time adjustments.
Integrating color and weight sensors for precision in measurement and mixing.
Collaborating in mechanical design to create a functional and user-friendly interface.
This project enhanced my skills in embedded systems, circuit design, motor control, and creative problem solving, ultimately resulting in a reliable and cost-effective solution for paint mixing automation.
